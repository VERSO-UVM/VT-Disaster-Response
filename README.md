# Vermont Disaster Response

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note, this repository contains semi-functional prototypes, resources/inspiration, demo data, and mockups. It is not currently being developed as a full Disaster Response tool.

**For form information:** [FORM.md](/FORM.md)

## Goals

1. Simplify the process of reporting floods, fires, road closures, structure damage, etc. with a lightweight interface that can collect as much information as possible.
2. Provide a closer to real-time view of how many people and what areas are affected by a disaster. This can help states hit the minimum threshold to request assistance from FEMA, faster.
3. Aggregate reports of efforts across organizations (like the United Way/Vermont211), state/local government emergency management personnel, and volunteer groups.
